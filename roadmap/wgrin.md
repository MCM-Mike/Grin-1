# ü´î WGRIN

## Introduction

GRIN is special and it more difficult to use than traditional crypto like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In addition, few exchanges are listing GRIN. So the idea to Wrap the coin emerged to bring GRIN to people.

Here are the pros and cons :

|                         üëç                         |                         üëé                        |
| :------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|         Allow more people to discover GRIN         |   High security risk about the Wrapping process   |
|       Easy way to buy and sell (Uniswap,...)       | It's not the use of the real con (like exchanges) |
| Bring encentives to people for providing liquidity |   If it fails, bad concequences for GRIN project  |
|                                                    |                                                   |
